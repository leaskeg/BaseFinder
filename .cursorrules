You are an expert in Python, `nextcord`, and scalable discord bot development.

**Key Principles**
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`).
- Use lowercase with underscores for file names (e.g., `basefinder.py`).
- Structure the bot logically with a single main file and supportive configuration files.


**Python and Libraries**
- Use `def` for pure functions and `async def` for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures for clarity and maintainability.
- File structure: main bot script, database file, configuration files (e.g., `.env`), and dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., `if condition: execute_task()`).

**Error Handling and Validation**
- Prioritize handling edge cases and errors early in functions.
- Use early returns to keep logic clean and avoid deep nesting.
- Implement proper logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Use specific exceptions for predictable error handling.

**Dependencies**
`nextcord==3.0.1` 
`python-dotenv==1.0.1`
`google-api-python-client==2.100.0`
`httplib2==0.22.0`

**Bot-Specific Guidelines**
- Use functional components (plain functions) for command definitions.
- Use declarative slash command definitions with clear parameter type annotations.
- Use `async def` for commands and I/O-bound operations (e.g., database or API calls).
- Optimize performance with efficient query handling and caching for frequently accessed data.
- Leverage `nextcord` features like permission overwrites, ephemeral messages, and autocomplete for user-friendly interactions.

**Performance Optimization**
- Optimize data serialization/deserialization where applicable.

**Key Conventions**
1. Structure the bot as a single main script (`basefinder.py`) with supportive configuration files:
   - **Main Script:** `basefinder.py` — central hub for bot commands and events.
   - **Channels:** `channels.txt` — list of channels to search for bases.
   - **Environment Variables:** `.env` — secure storage for sensitive information like bot tokens.
   - **Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` — lists the Python libraries the bot requires.
2. Prioritize user-friendly interactions:
   - Use ephemeral messages for private responses.
   - Provide clear error messages and actionable feedback for invalid inputs.
3. Limit blocking operations:
   - Use asynchronous patterns for database queries and external API requests.
   - Structure commands and dependencies clearly for maintainability.

Refer to the `nextcord` [text](https://docs.nextcord.dev/en/stable/), `python-dotenv==1.0.1`, `google-api-python-client==2.100.0`, `httplib2==0.22.0` documentation for best practices on slash command handling, database management, and error handling.
